      Make the Code Easier to Read

      Write code so anyone can immediately understand whatâ€™s happening
      It should be understandable without relying on comments.

      Use simple functionCase for all functions and code_case for all variables.
      Keep functions and variables short, clear, and self-explanatory.

      NOW, fix that code!
